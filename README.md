## Reverse Engineers' Hex Editor | rehex by Daniel Collins (solemnwarning)

For taking notes and learning we need a proper Hex Editor, for this time I will use:  
https://github.com/solemnwarning/rehex/releases/download/0.3.91/rehex-0.3.91-win-x86_64.zip

### Bugs in the rehex
### Not rendering after opening a file
After opening a file with rehex, there is a need to use Mouse to scroll up and down to trigger the proper rendering by rehex.


### Unable to insert `at the end of line` in the ASCII viewer or in the Hex Dump 
Simply press `down key` on the keyboard and it will take you to the last character or at the end of the Hex line.
